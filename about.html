                    <p>Nourishmii was originally born as a small, high raw and vegan catering company in the Blue Mountains, NSW. Through pop up events and engaging with the public a desire arose to create plant based foods, that were convenient and fun to eat!</p>
                    <p>Founder, Iman Eve started out studying Naturopathy but life took her down a different path and 10 years later she had turned into a pretty handy sommelier, and was well on the way to raising two beautiful boys. But she always secretly desired to be creating gourmet meals inspired by the numerous Chefs she got to meet and work with. Her consciousness took a turn in the right direction, and her back ground in naturopathy started to synergise with the meals she was creating for her family. It wasn’t long before friends realised that healthy eating could be gourmet, indulgent and beautiful too! And so Nourishmii was conceived.</p>
                    <p>After floating some superfood ideas with her eco-nut friend Craig Martin, plans were hatched to share the delights of dragon fruit with Australia. From as little as 9 years old Craig caught a bug for all things green from his Great Aunt Vera. Converting his passion for rock climbing to swinging around trees, from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney to the NSW National Parks and Wildlife, he continues to pursue innovative environmental management. Craig’s commitment to Nourishmii’s triple bottom line: Economic Efficiency/Environmental Sustainability/Social Wellbeing keeps us as green and socially responsible as possible.</p>
                    <p>Enter Craig’s climbing buddy Todd Martin – no relation! Todd is truly the international social, digital and mobile superstar. Over the past two decades there’s not many major brands he hasn’t worked with or indeed launched. But if the truth be known he would rather be converting old BMW bikes to funky café racers or catching that elusive wave. Nourishmii’s passion for introducing new superfoods to the market floats his boat and he loves dragon fruit smoothies!!</p>
